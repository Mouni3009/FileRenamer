FileRenamer:

A simple and beginner-friendly C++ program that automatically renames all files in a folder using a consistent naming pattern like `image_1.jpg`, `image_2.jpg`, and so on.

Description:

Manually renaming dozens of files one by one can be a time-consuming and error-prone task. This project offers a lightweight utility written in C++ that helps automate the process. Whether you're organizing photos, downloads, or test data, this tool will rename all the files in a specified folder sequentially in just a few seconds.

For example, if you have a folder containing files with random or inconsistent names, this program will rename them to:
image_1.jpg
image_2.jpg
image_3.jpg
...

This is especially useful for organizing image datasets, scanned documents, or anything where file naming consistency matters.
